# Eris-Protection
Originally I was going to invite Brownie, Vaz, Dort, and Cystemz (Maybe) to
assist in this protection,

But since I'm probably discontinuing Eris to work on my hcf server this old prot
system coded in java will be open to the public.

Plans to re-continue eris will continue once I know more about
Hypixel's scaffold and movement checks. Currently I don't have
enough alts or time to figure out how they work.

This java prot was created by me, feel free to use it in any of your
projects as long as you give me creddit through annotations in 
the code, and text giving me credit in some sort of ingame
or in gui message.
